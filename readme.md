# Ethwatcher Go Library

![](https://github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

**This is a forked and refactored version of the https://github.com/HydroProtocol/ethereum-watcher library, and the documentation is not up to date.**

ethereum-watcher is an event listener for the [Ethereum Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/) written in Golang. With ethereum-watcher you can monitor and track current or historic events that occur on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Background

Many applications that interact with the Ethereum Blockchain need to know when specific actions occur on the chain, but cannot directly access the on-chain data. ethereum-watcher acts as an interface between application and chain: gathering specified data from the blockchain so that applications can more seamlessly interact with on-chain events.


## Features

1. Plug-in friendly. You can easily add a plugin to ethereum-watcher to listen to any type of on-chain event.
2. Fork Tolerance. If a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(blockchain)) occurs, a revert message is sent to the subscriber.

## Example Use Cases

- [DefiWatch](https://defiwatch.io/) monitors the state of Ethereum addresses on several DeFi platforms including DDEX, Compound, DyDx, and Maker. It tracks things like loan ROI, current borrows, liquidations, etc. To track all of this on multiple platforms, DefiWatch has to continuously receive updates from their associated smart contracts. This is done using ethereum-watcher instead of spending time dealing with serialization/deserialization messages from the Ethereum Node, so they can focus on their core logic.   
- Profit & Loss calculations on [DDEX](https://ddex.io). DDEX provides their margin trading users with estimated Profit and Loss (P&L) calculations for their margin positions. To update the P&L as timely and accurately as possible, DDEX uses ethereum-watcher to listen to updates from the Ethereum Blockchain. These updates include: onchain price updates, trading actions from users, and more.
- DDEX also uses an "Eth-Transaction-Watcher" to monitor the on-chain status of trading transactions. DDEX needs to know the latest states of these transactions once they are included in newly mined blocks, so that the platform properly updates trading balances and histories. This is done using the `TxReceiptPlugin` of ethereum-watcher.

Here the flag `--block-backoff` signals for ethereum-watcher to use historic tracking from 100 blocks ago.

# Usage

To effectively use ethereum-watcher, you will be interacting with two primary structs:

- Watcher
- ReceiptLogWatcher

## Watcher

`Watcher` is an HTTP client which continuously polls newly mined blocks on the Ethereum Blockchain. We can incorporate various kinds of "plugins" into `Watcher`, which will poll for specific types of events and data, such as:

- BlockPlugin
- TransactionPlugin
- TransactionReceiptPlugin
- ReceiptLogPlugin

Once the `Watcher` sees a new block, it will parse the info and feed the data into the registered plugins. You can see some of the code examples [below](#watcher-examples).

The plugins are designed to be easily modifiable so that you can create your own plugin based on the provided ones. For example, the code shown [below](#listen-for-new-erc20-transfer-events) registers an `ERC20TransferPlugin` to show new ERC20 Transfer Events. This plugin simply parses some receipt info from a different `TransactionReceiptPlugin`. So if you want to show more info than what the `ERC20TransferPlugin` shows, like the gas used in the transaction, you can easily create a `BetterERC20TransferPlugin` showing that.

### Watcher Examples

#### Print number of newly mined blocks

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/plugin"
	"github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/structs"
)

func main() {
	api := "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/19d753b2600445e292d54b1ef58d4df4"
	w := NewHttpBasedEthWatcher(context.Background(), api)

	// we use BlockPlugin here
	w.RegisterBlockPlugin(plugin.NewBlockNumPlugin(func(i uint64, b bool) {
		fmt.Println(">>", i, b)
	}))

	w.RunTillExit()
}
```

#### Listen for new ERC20 Transfer Events

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/plugin"
	"github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/structs"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
	api := "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/19d753b2600445e292d54b1ef58d4df4"
	w := NewHttpBasedEthWatcher(context.Background(), api)

	// we use TxReceiptPlugin here
	w.RegisterTxReceiptPlugin(plugin.NewERC20TransferPlugin(
		func(token, from, to string, amount decimal.Decimal, isRemove bool) {

			logrus.Infof("New ERC20 Transfer >> token(%s), %s -> %s, amount: %s, isRemoved: %t",
				token, from, to, amount, isRemove)

		},
	))

	w.RunTillExit()
}
```

## ReceiptLogWatcher

`Watcher` is polling for blocks one by one, so what if we want to query certain events from the latest 10000 blocks? `Watcher` can do that but fetching blocks one by one can be slow. `ReceiptLogWatcher` to the rescue!

`ReceiptLogWatcher` makes use of the `eth_getLogs` to query for logs in a batch. Check out the code [below](#example-of-receiptlogwatcher) to see how to use it.


### Example of ReceiptLogWatcher

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/rakshasa/ethwatcher/blockchain"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
	api := "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/19d753b2600445e292d54b1ef58d4df4"
	usdtContractAdx := "0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7"
  
	// ERC20 Transfer Event
	topicsInterestedIn := []string{"0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef"}

	handler := func(from, to int, receiptLogs []blockchain.IReceiptLog, isUpToHighestBlock bool) error {
		logrus.Infof("USDT Transfer count: %d, %d -> %d", len(receiptLogs), from, to)
		return nil
	}

	// query for USDT Transfer Events
	receiptLogWatcher := NewReceiptLogWatcher(
		context.TODO(),
		api,
		-1,
		usdtContractAdx,
		topicsInterestedIn,
		handler,
		ReceiptLogWatcherConfig{
			StepSizeForBigLag:               5,
			IntervalForPollingNewBlockInSec: 5,
			RPCMaxRetry:                     3,
			ReturnForBlockWithNoReceiptLog:  true,
		},
	)

	receiptLogWatcher.Run()
}
```
